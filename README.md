# table

Interactive dinner table for two. 

Utensils (fork, knife, spoon, plate) are wired as capacitive sensors. Sounds unique to each utensil are triggered when the utensil is touched. 

A four-voice drone sounds when utensils are at rest. When a utensil is picked up and put back down, one voice of the drone rests on a new scale degree.

Utilizes Teensy Audio Library.
